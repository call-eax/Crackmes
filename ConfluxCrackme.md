I'm solving the crackme from https://crackmy.app/crackmes/keygenme-conflux1-by-conflux-by-crackmes-de-37597

It has been chosen randomly by clicking the "I'm feeling lucky" button on the website's advanced search form.
I recorded my screen while solving this crackme, so no dedicated writup is available (read: lazy slob :grin:).

The video has been split into 4 parts to meet Youtube's "we will let you upload longer videos only if you give us your telephone number" criteria for
unverified users.

This is my first video of this sort, so of course I made a big boo boo by placing a semicolon at the end of an if statement and not noticing it until after the video was finished.
